# Greenhouse Monitor
This is a device that keeps track of the temperature in my greenhouse and will help heat or cool depending on conditions.

## Overview
Every year my wife and I spend a small forture on plants for the flower beds.  At the end of summer, we dig up the ones we want to save
the most and place them in plastic containers.  We keep the containers in our garage all winter long so the plants don't freeze.  The
bad thing about this is that all the plants take up a lot of garage space.  In addition to this, our garage has no windows, so the plants
suffer from not getting enough sunlight.   

This fall, we decided to try building a small greenhouse out back to keep the plants in.  The problem is, that we get weather where the
temperature can dip below freezing for prolonged periods of time.  I knew that there would be times where the temperature in the
greenhouse would dip below freezing as well.  So I needed something to help generate some heat during those cold spells.

This project is a temperature sensor and a few relays that turn on/off based on the temperature.  One relay turns on heat lamps that
provide heat when it is cold.  The other relay activates a fan that will help cool the greenhouse should the temperature get too warm.
